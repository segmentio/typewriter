* handle values with multiple types (including null) [SCH-1643] ([#57](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/issues/57)) ([6cce0f7](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/commit/6cce0f7))



## [6.1.2](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/compare/6.1.1...6.1.2) (2019-02-26)



## [6.1.1](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/compare/6.1.0...6.1.1) (2019-01-31)


### Bug Fixes

# [6.1.0](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/compare/6.0.0...6.1.0) (2019-01-31)


### Features

* custom error handlers ([#52](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/issues/52)) ([7f073d8](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/commit/7f073d8))



# [6.0.0](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/compare/5.1.8...6.0.0) (2019-01-30)


### Bug Fixes

* javascript clients accepted context rather than options ([#51](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/issues/51)) ([5222145](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter/commit/5222145))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* if you previously passed `context` directly as the final
  parameter to the `analytics.js` or `analytics-node` clients, then you'll
  need to update it, like so:

  If you made a call like:

  ```
  typewriter.thingHappened({ when: 'now' }, { groupId: 123 })
  ```

  Then you would need to update it to:

  ```
  typewriter.thingHappened({ when: 'now' }, {
    context: { groupId: 123 }
  })
  ```

  This allows you to pass `integrations` and other fields in through this
  object, and aligns the TypeScript declarations with the underlying library.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The `gen-ts` command has been removed. We no longer generate native `ts` clients, in favor of our JS client with TS declarations. You should now generate the TS client with `typewriter gen-js --declarations=ts`
* Protocols-related flags (`--token`, `--workspaceSlug`, and `--trackingPlanId`) have been removed from the various `gen-*` commands. Users should now use the `sync` command to fetch their Tracking Plans, and the `gen-* --inputPath` flag to generate a client from that local JSON Schema.
