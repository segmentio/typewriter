# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for working with Segment and contributing to its projects. To contribute to one of its projects, Segment.io, Inc. (“Segment”) requires that you (“Contributor” or “You”) accept this Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”).  This license protects you as a contributor and Segment and its users and licensees.  If you do not agree to these terms, please do not contribute to this project.

By contributing to a Segment project, You agree to these terms for all of your Contributions to Segment.

1. Definitions.
<br/><br/>
“You” (or “Your”) is the owner of copyright, or an entity or person the copyright owner authorizes, making a Contribution to this project and contracting with Segment.
<br/><br/>
“Contribution” is any original work of authorship or invention, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that You submit to Segment to include in, or documentation of, the products owned or managed by Segment (the “Work”).  A contribution includes any communication to Segment about or related to a Segment project using any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication, but excluding a communication conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. Grant of Copyright License. You grant to Segment and to recipients of software Segment distributes a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works, and the right to sublicense and have sublicensed the foregoing rights, through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

3. Grant of Patent License. You grant to Segment and to recipients of software distributed by Segment a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you may grant the above licenses. If any other party (including your employer) has rights to intellectual property you create that includes your Contributions, you represent and warrant you have that party’s permission to make Contributions, the party has waived rights for your Contribution, or that party has agreed to this Agreement or a substantially similar agreement with Segment.

5. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant You have the authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations in this Agreement.

6. You represent that Your Contributions are Your original creations.  You may not make contributions subject to any third-party license or other restrictions (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) other than your own, except as described in paragraph 7.

7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission, unless You choose to.  Unless required by law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

8. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Segment separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) and conspicuously marking the work as “Not a Contribution. Third-party materials licensed pursuant to: MIT”.

9. You agree to notify Segment of any facts or circumstances of which you learn would make these representations inaccurate.

10. Information about Submissions. You agree that Segment may maintain Contributions to Projects and information about contributions indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other information You submit with Your Submission.

11. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal or state courts sitting in San Francisco, California.  The parties waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.

12. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes any prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. Segment may assign this Agreement.
